#### HW1: Write six Python scripts implementing depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), and Iterative Deepening Search (IDS), each with and without a visited list.

#### HW2: soundness and completeness, A star search, DFS and BFS

#### HW3: Constraint Satisfaction Problems - AC-3, Implement the following algorithms to solve the n-queens problem - Standard Search, Backtrack Search,  Backtrack Search with Forward Checking (FC), Iterative Repair (Min-Conflict Heuristic)

#### HW4: Implement* an activity planner that parses in PDDL domain and problem files and returns an optimal solution (i.e., an “activity plan”) & Implement RRT to find a collision-free path from the start to goal locations.
